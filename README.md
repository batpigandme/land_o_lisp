My code as I go through Conrad Barski's [Land of Lisp](http://landoflisp.com/) bookâ€¦ 

This code will be ugly. I'm new to this. Sorry.

[Land of Lisp](https://nostarch.com/lisp.htm) has its very own [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HM1Zb3xmvMc), which is hilarious and awesome (kind of like the entire book).

You'll be eating parentheses for breakfast in no time...

Seriously, check it (and <http://landoflisp.com/>) out...
